    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
    <p>
    <b>What is your interest in IT?</b><br>
    I choose to study IT after getting interested in creating mobile applications.  I am also looking to learn how to <br>
    code video games, mainly RPGs, and idle games.<br>
    <br>
    <b>When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>
    I've had an interest in game development for quite a while, however I was uncertain whether I had the ability to <br>
    learn how to code, as I was always under the impression you needed a high level of mathematical skill to do able <br>
    to learn how to code.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b><br>
    I've always thought about creating my own RPG ever since I first played World of Warcraft, back in 2004.  I've <br>
    played a few games since then that have stoked my interest in creating a game, as they never truly satisfy the <br>
    desire that I want to be fulfilled.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
    I choose RMIT as it offered the classes I wanted to study.<br>
    <br>
    <b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
    I expect to learn how to code with different languages, as well as to problem solve issues with different programming <br>
    languages.<br>
    <br>

    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
    <p>
      <h3>Myers-Briggs test</h3><br>
      <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ Personality</a><br>
      Architect (INTJ)<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Introverted<b/> 72%</li>
        <li><b>Intuitive</b> 54%</li>
        <li><bThinking></b> 55%</li>
        <li><b>Judging</b> 53%</li>
        <li><b>Turbulent</b> 74%</li>
      <br><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
      I find that a pretty accurate. I tend to prefer to work alone, or in small teams (Introverted).  I find that results should be based upon merit alone, and if a person puts in the effort, and achieves the end result, then they should be rewarded for it.<br>
      <br><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br>
      I don't put myself forwards for leadership roles, as I don't believe my personality is suited for that sort of role.  I prefer to just do the work that I have been assigned.<br>
      <br><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
      When forming teams, it would make sense for someone who is highly Extraverted to take the lead, someone who would fit into the Commander (ENTJ), Protagonist (ENFJ) or Executive (ESTJ) personality types, as these personality types enjoy leadership roles.<br>
      <h3>Learning Style</h3>
      <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=9&V=8&T=3">Learning Style Results</a><br>
      Auditory learner<br>
      <br><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
      This test shows that I prefer to learn by listening to others speak about a topic.<br>
      <br><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br>
      This test shows that I would prefer to listen to others during team meetings.<br>
      <br><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
      I would prefer for team meetings to be performed in person or over a voice conference software, so that I can hear what others have to say.<br>
      <h3>The Big Five Personality Test</h3><br>
      <a href="https://www.truity.com/test-results/bigfive/17315/21428611">Your Personality Trait Scores</a><br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Openness</b> 71%</li>
        <li><b>Conscientiousness</b> 50%</li>
        <li><b>Extraversion</b> 25%</li>
        <li><b>Agreeableness</b> 67%</li>
        <li><b>Neuroticism</b> 90%</li>
      </ul>
      <br><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
      I am a highly creative person, who can think of subject in a abtract manner (Openness).  I am a peacemaker, and will try to put the needs and views of others before my own (Conscientiousness).  However, I am highly critical and I am highly susceptible to negative emotions (Neuroticism).<br>
      <br><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b><br>
      I prefer a structured approach to teamwork, where tasks are decided and then delegated to members.  These members would need to perform their tasks in a timely manner<br>
      <br><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
      As long as the team members followed a structured approach, and get their assigned tasks performed in a timely manner, there shouldn't be any issues.  However, when things don't go as planned, I can find myself stressed easily.<br>
